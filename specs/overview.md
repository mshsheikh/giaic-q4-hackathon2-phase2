# Todo Web App - Project Overview

## Purpose
This project is a multi-user Todo web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their personal tasks in a secure and intuitive interface. The application provides user authentication, task management, and data isolation between users.

## Current Phase
Phase II: Full-stack web application with comprehensive specifications, architecture, authentication model, API contracts, and database schema defined using Spec-Kit Plus methodology. This phase focuses on creating detailed specifications without implementation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and React Server Components
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with async support
- **Database**: SQLModel with Neon PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth for JWT-based authentication
- **Architecture**: Monorepo structure
- **API Style**: RESTful with JSON responses
- **Security**: JWT tokens, HTTPS, input validation, and data isolation

## Evolution Roadmap

### Phase I → Phase II
- **Phase I**: Basic foundation and initial setup
- **Phase II**: Full-stack specification with detailed architecture, authentication, API contracts, and database schema
- **Phase III**: Implementation of frontend and backend based on specifications

### Phase II Deliverables
- Complete specification suite for all features
- Architecture specification with component interactions
- Authentication and authorization model
- Comprehensive API contract definitions
- Database schema with relationships and constraints
- UI/UX specifications for all components and pages
- Security and data isolation requirements

## Success Criteria
- All specifications are complete and internally consistent
- Authentication model supports multi-user data isolation
- API contracts are clearly defined with proper error handling
- Database schema supports all required features
- UI specifications cover all necessary components and pages
- Security requirements are thoroughly addressed
- Specifications are ready for Phase III implementation
